# My First C# Project

## Overview  
This project was my introduction to C# and OOP, built using the **MonoGame** library (originally version 3.0) and **.NET Framework 4.5**. It served as a foundation for learning programming concepts and game development basics.  

## Features  
- 2D graphics rendering with MonoGame  
- Basic game loop for updates and rendering  
- Simple gameplay mechanics and menu navigation  
- Keyboard input handling  

## Technologies  
- **MonoGame 3.0** (initially, later updated to 3.8)  
- **.NET Framework 4.5**  (initially, later updated to .net8.0)
